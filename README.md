I'm Zijian, currently a graduate student studying Data Science at the university of Pennsylvania (UPenn). Previously, I obtained both my master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering my bachelor's degree with double major in Computer Science and Pure Mathematics at the University of Michigan (UMich).

- 🔭 Research-wise, I'm mainly working on topics related to data-centric techniques, including Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Currently, I am a research assistant at the [Wharton AI & Analytics for Business (AIAB) lab](https://aiab.wharton.upenn.edu/) of the [Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/) of UPenn. Previously, I am a research assistant in the [SOCR](https://www.socr.umich.edu/index.html) group working on a clinical notes de-indentification system using NLP and deep learning techiques. And I was a research assistant at [Prof. Kim's Lab](https://kim.engin.umich.edu/) working on the audio source localization.
- 🎯 I worked on the integration between Alexa and Knowledge Graph for my internship at Amazon during the summer of 2020, and Amazon business payments during the summer of 2022.
- 🐾 I also like proof-based math, and I was a undergraduate researcher at the [Lab of Geometry (LoG(M))](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/undergraduates/research-and-career-opportunities/LoGM.html) working on Hilbert Polynomials. Our work has been published [here](https://rdcu.be/cyDDg).
